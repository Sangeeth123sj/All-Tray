# All-Tray
Booktray new version in django with new features, rebuilt from ground up, let's get this running asap and startup ;)
 To run this app : 
              Fork this app.
              git clone this app to your desired folder from your profile
              switch to the app folder
              create a new git branch from master and pull into new branch from master
              work on the new branch
              add a virtual env also in the same folder where you cloned the booktray but not inside booktray. 
              Then activate virtual environment in terminal and pip install django (version 3.1)
              switch to app folder and run django server.
              put a pull request to master from your branch when you need have commited and pushed changes to your branch.
              Happy building ;)
