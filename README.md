# All-Tray
Booktray new version in django with new features, rebuilt from ground up, let's get this running asap and startup ;)
 To run this app : 
              git clone this app to yourdesired folder, then add a virtual env also in the same folder where you cloned the booktray but not inside booktray. Then activate virtual environment in terminal and switch to app folder and run django server.
              Happy building ;)
